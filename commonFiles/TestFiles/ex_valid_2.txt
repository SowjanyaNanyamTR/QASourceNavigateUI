<smp><ital>In 4Q14, EU systemic stress increased slightly, showing higher volatility than in the previous period. Contagion risk remained broadly stable at sustained levels. Liquidity and market risk held persistently high levels, with market risk partially materialising in the reporting period. The release of lower-than-expected macroeconomic data at the beginning of 4Q14 was followed by significant price swings and increased volatility in both EU and US markets. Increasing risk perception raised the pressure on market liquidity in the EU. Credit risk is high but may ease in the near future as major steps to ensure and increase soundness and stability in the banking system were taken in 2014 with the AQR and stress test exercise.</ital></smp>
<smp><bold>Systemic stress:</bold> Following its 3Q14 increase, systemic stress displayed higher volatility than in the previous reporting period, though remaining at relatively low levels, in line with continued monetary support. The rise in volatility was due mainly to equity markets first falling in October and then recovering at the end of the year. At the beginning of the quarter increased implied volatilities, the downturn in equity prices and lower P/E ratios signalled that valuation concerns were beginning to materialise in the markets, although they continued to fluctuate over the quarter. In fixed income markets prices remained high, even if they did differ more across asset classes, while risk premia were low, pointing to persistent valuation risks. The higher implied fixed income volatilities suggest that the potential for market corrections is high. Drivers possibly include weaker-than-expected economic recovery, persisting downside influences including geopolitical tensions, local pockets of stress in debt markets, expectations of divergent monetary policies, commodity price and exchange rate dynamics, and the increasing emergence of vulnerabilities in market functioning.</smp>
<smp><bold>Economic environment</bold></smp>
<smp><bold>Macroeconomic conditions:</bold> The release of lower-than-expected macroeconomic data at the beginning of 4Q14 was followed by significant price swings and increases in volatility in both EU and US markets. The persisting economic weakness and low inflation outlook in EU, uncertainty over the commitment to further structural reforms by some Member States and subdued global economic growth have raised concerns in financial markets, with valuations in riskier assets softening while increasing for safer assets. External risk factors stemming from emerging markets, including Russia, Ukraine and China, further complicated the macroeconomic context for markets. Yet in November, better-than-expected performance statistics released on the two largest EU economies contributed to a recovery in EU financial markets.</smp> 
<smp><bold>Interest-rate environment:</bold> Monetary policy support remained strong, as interest rates persisted at record lows, having crossed the zero bound, and the ECB decided on additional measures to bolster credit, namely TLTRO, ABS and covered bond purchases by the central bank. Within the sustained low-interest rate environment there were signs of search-for-yield behaviour slowing amid a revived appetite for safer assets, and yield compression in government and corporate bond markets came to a halt. This is potentially associated with heightened uncertainty surrounding the future economic outlook and interest rate expectations across major economic areas.</smp>
<smp><bold>Sovereign-bank nexus:</bold> The AQR and stress-test results were published in 4Q14. The EBA EU-wide stress test saw 24 banks out of 123 falling below the required capital thresholds, with a total capital shortfall of EUR 24.6bn. During 2014, important actions were taken on capital, reducing capital requirements to EUR 9.5bn and the number of banks with a shortfall to 14. The Joint Supervisors Team will supervise plans to address the capital shortfalls identified. Major steps were thus taken in 2014 in the banking sector to ensure and increase soundness and stability in the system and reduce the risks of spill-overs from the real economy and sovereigns to the banks.</smp> 
<smp><bold>Conditions in securities markets</bold></smp>
<smp><bold>Risks in EU sovereign debt markets:</bold> The recent negative economic news and mounting uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of policy measures depressed market confidence and was reflected in increased yields and higher variability, particularly in some more vulnerable economies. Pricing of risk remained low, as reflected by the still relatively high sovereign bond valuation, although this became increasingly volatile and fluctuated sharply, especially for two more vulnerable countries, signalling increasing market uncertainty.</smp> 
<smp><bold>Market clustering:</bold> Bond yield correlation between sovereigns and corporates in the same jurisdiction continued to be broadly stable at high levels. Correlation among sovereigns declined a little, especially for some weaker economies, within a higher-dispersion context.</smp> 
<smp><bold>Funding risk:</bold> Short-term funding requirements appear to have fallen across sectors (cf. R.21), with maturities remaining broadly constant. The important supervisory changes characterising the banking sector could improve the stability and soundness of the system. It should be noted, however, that liquidity risks may arise from country-specific differences, potential market imbalances and reduced incentives for market-makers in providing liquidity.</smp> 
<smp>Valuation risk: Low interest rates persisted in the EU, with yields lingering at very low levels. However, risk perception increased. Potential drivers include increasing concerns surrounding economic growth and the risk of low inflation in EU as well as increased global uncertainty uncertainty over US future monetary policy stance, worsened global economic outlook, low oil price and more volatile exchange rate dynamics. The sudden stock and bond price swings observed at the beginning of 4Q14 seemed to reflect a materialisation of market risk, expected to remain high in the light of persistent uncertainty regarding economic fundamentals.</smp>
